    description: "YoKaisho is the combination of a modern day tablet app and a tra- ditional board game. While designing the game it was important to our team that we would create a game which has the typical cozy and collaborative features of a board game as well as the great possibilities and actions of a video game. Inspired by Japan's myths and culture YoKaisho features a very unique style and gameplay. It was created using Unity and Vuforia.",
